For this challenge, you will complete the code below to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)

Some of the code is given to you but some code you must fill in to complete this challenge. Read the instruction in each text cell so you will know what you have to do in each code cell.

The first code cell imports the required libraries. The second code cell downloads the data and sets key variables. The third cell is the first place you will write your own code.

The structure of the dataset files that are downloaded looks like this (You will notice that the test directory has no subdirectories and the images are not labeled):
```
cats_and_dogs
|__ train:
    |______ cats: [cat.0.jpg, cat.1.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg ...]
|__ validation:
    |______ cats: [cat.2000.jpg, cat.2001.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.2000.jpg, dog.2001.jpg ...]
|__ test: [1.jpg, 2.jpg ...]
```

You can tweak epochs and batch size if you like, but it is not required.

"""Now it is your turn! Set each of the variables below correctly. (They should no longer equal `None`.)

Create image generators for each of the three image data sets (train, validation, test). Use `ImageDataGenerator` to read / decode the images and convert them into floating point tensors. Use the `rescale` argument (and no other arguments for now) to rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1.

For the `*_data_gen` variables, use the `flow_from_directory` method. Pass in the batch size, directory, target size (`(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH)`), class mode, and anything else required. `test_data_gen` will be the trickiest one. For `test_data_gen`, make sure to pass in `shuffle=False` to the `flow_from_directory` method. This will make sure the final predictions stay is in the order that our test expects. For `test_data_gen` it will also be helpful to observe the directory structure.


After you run the code, the output should look like this:
```
Found 2000 images belonging to 2 classes.
Found 1000 images belonging to 2 classes.
Found 50 images belonging to 1 classes.
